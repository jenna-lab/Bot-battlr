A React application that displays a list of available bots, among other features. 

## Setup/Installation Requirements
- Download the zip file under the code tab.

json-server --watch db.json

-Test your server by visiting this route in the browser:
http://localhost:8001/bots
-Run npm Start
- And the you are good to go.

## Requirement
React
JSON

## BDD
As a user, I should be able to:

See profiles of all bots rendered in BotCollection.
Add an individual bot to my army by clicking on it. The selected bot should render in the YourBotArmy component. The bot can be enlisted only once. The bot does not disappear from the BotCollection.
Release a bot from my army by clicking on it. The bot disappears from the YourBotArmy component.
Discharge a bot from their service forever, by clicking the red button marked "x", which would delete the bot both from the backend and from the YourBotArmy on the frontend.

# Bugs
